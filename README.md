Plant Disease Detection Application

A mobile application that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Learning techniques to detect plant diseases from photos.

Overview

This application takes a photo of a plant as input, analyzes it using a combination of LLMs (via Gemini API) and Deep Learning models (Convolutional Neural Networks), and generates a report detailing the detected disease.

Features

- Plant disease detection using LLMs and Deep Learning models
- Image analysis and processing using CNNs
- Report generation detailing the detected disease
- Integration with Gemini API for LLM-based analysis

Technical Details

- Frontend: Mobile application built using Android Studio
- Backend: Deep Learning models (CNNs) and LLMs (via Gemini API)
- Programming languages: Java, Python
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch

Requirements

- Android device with camera
- Internet connection for API calls
- Gemini API key (for LLM-based analysis)

Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Android application using Android Studio
3. Install the application on an Android device
4. Obtain a Gemini API key and integrate it with the application

Usage

1. Open the application and take a photo of a plant
2. The application will analyze the image and generate a report
3. View the report to see the detected disease
